# Fish Catcher Unity - Setup Guide

## Quick Start

1. **Open in Unity 6 LTS** (2022.3+ also works)
   - Open Unity Hub > Add > Browse to `FishCatcherUnity/`
   - Unity will import all scripts and create the project metadata

2. **Install TextMeshPro**
   - When prompted, click "Import TMP Essentials"
   - Or: Window > TextMeshPro > Import TMP Essential Resources

3. **Build Scenes** (one-click setup)
   - Go to **Window > Fish Catcher > Build Scenes**
   - Click **"Build All"** — this creates:
     - `Assets/Prefabs/FishPrefab.prefab` (procedural fish with sprite, collider, scripts)
     - `Assets/Scenes/HomeScreen.unity` (title screen with play button)
     - `Assets/Scenes/Game.unity` (main game with claw, fish spawner, bucket, UI)
   - All references are auto-wired

4. **Add Scenes to Build Settings**
   - File > Build Settings
   - Drag `HomeScreen` and `Game` scenes into the scene list
   - HomeScreen should be index 0

5. **Play!**
   - Open `HomeScreen` scene and press Play

## iOS Build

1. File > Build Settings > Switch to iOS
2. Open Player Settings and configure:
   - Bundle ID: Set to your `BUNDLE_ID` value from `.env`
   - Team ID: Set to your `APPLE_TEAM_ID` value from `.env`
   - Portrait orientation
   - Target iOS 15.0+
3. Build > Open Xcode project > Archive & upload

## Replacing Procedural Art with Real Sprites

The game uses procedural sprites by default (matching the original Godot game).
To upgrade to real art:

1. Import sprite assets into `Assets/Sprites/`
2. On the FishPrefab, replace the SpriteRenderer sprite with your fish sprite
3. On the Claw objects in the Game scene, replace sprites on ClawBase/ClawLeft/ClawRight
4. On the DropZone, replace the bucket sprite
5. Remove `ProceduralSetup` component from the fish prefab if using real sprites
